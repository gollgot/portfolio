                            and Engineering Vaud (HEIG-VD) in specialization software engineering.
                            Before this training, I started by a CFC as a computer scientist, then I carried out with
                            studies in a technical college (ES) in applications' development. I was able to acquire a lot of
                            practical experience within different companies. Afterwards, I pursued my studies in order to
                            become an engineer.
                            <br><br>
                            My favorite fields are all those related to the web, more particularly the backend, web
                            applications and websites. I also really like native Android mobile development and API design.
                            During my many lessons and my free time, I was able to carry out several interesting and
                            varied projects, which I let you discover at the bottom of this portfolio.",
